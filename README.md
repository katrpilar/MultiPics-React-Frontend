## Getting Started

In the project directory, you run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

The app should now be running in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Requesting Required External API Keys

In order to use this project you'll need to request API credentials from three external APIs:
####Unsplash

* Copy and save your 'Access Key' somewhere on your machine for later reference
* The Unsplash Access Key will be stored in the `REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable

####Pexels
* Follow the instructions to create a Pexels account and [https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/](Request Pexels Developer Access Here)
* Copy and save 'Your API key' somewhere on your machine for later reference
* The Pexels API Key will be stored in the `REACT_APP_PEXELS_API_KEY` environment variable

####Pixabay
* Follow the instructions to create a Pixabay account and [https://pixabay.com/api/docs/](Request Pixabay Developer Access Here)
* Copy and save 'Your API key' somewhere on your machine for later reference
* The Pexels API Key will be stored in the `REACT_APP_PIXABAY_API_KEY` environment variable

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
